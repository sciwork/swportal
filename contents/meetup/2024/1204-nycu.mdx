# About Meetup

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the
attendees, and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and
technology, which demand more critical discussions than other
applications of computer programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source
communities.

To join the meetup, please bring your laptop and [sign up](#sign-up).
Please [contact us](#contact-us) if you have any questions.

# Venue

The meetup venue is at [國立陽明交通大學 工程三館 3 樓 329 室 (Room 329,
Engineering Building 3, NYCU)](https://goo.gl/maps/TgDYwohB3CBmQgww9).
