# Meetup 2023 March in NYCU

- Date: March 15th, 22th and 29st, 2023
- Time: 18:30 \-- 21:30 (3 hours)
- [Meetup note](#meetup-note)

To join the meetup, please bring your laptop. You are also very welcome
to bring your project. Please [contact us](#contact-us) if you have any
questions.

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the
attendees, and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and
technology, which demand more critical discussions than other
applications of computer programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source
communities.

## Topic Discussion

We invite all attendees to suggest topics for the upcoming meetups,
which will feature approximately three 10-minute topics, and we welcome
suggestions from attendees. To list a few, the topic may be about
Modmesh, NSD, and NSD project, among others.
