## Subjects

### Physical Therapy Assessment with AI - Depth Camera for Mobility Analysis

Speaker : Nian-Cheng - A graduate student in NYCU Institute of
Artificial Intelligence Innovation.

In this topic, I leveraged data from depth cameras for AI model data
processing and introduces the essential tools I utilized for this
purpose.

### sciwork grand project

Host: Yung-Yu

In the past years sciwork communit is using the portal site
[https://sciwork.dev/](https://sciwork.dev/) to organize the events, including meetups and
sprints. The light-weight system is easy to use for programmers and very
effective. However, the portal is a static website that cannot
automatically organize all information. That is why github, netlify,
hackmd, and kktix are involved in the workflow.

More IT experts are joining the community. It is time to discuss whether
we want to upgrade the website. In this session I would like to propose
a project to upgrade the portal web page to a portal web app. It will be
a significant endeavor and named the sciwork grand project.

### Preparational meeting for August scisprint

Additionally, we will discuss the following items for preparing August
scisprint.

- Task arrangement for volunteers
- Promotion plan for August scisprint
- Preparations for career conversation

## Sign up

## About Meetup

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the
attendees, and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and
technology, which demand more critical discussions than other
applications of computer programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source
communities.

To join the meetup, please bring your laptop and [sign up](#sign-up).
You are also very welcome to bring your project. Please [contact
us](#contact-us) if you have any questions.
