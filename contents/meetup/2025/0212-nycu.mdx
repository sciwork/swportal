# Subjects

## modmesh discussion and training

### discussion

In the discussion session, we will discuss the following topics
simultaneously, and you can choose the topic you are interested in.

1.  [Use Bezier curve to fit NACA 4-digit
    airfoil](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh/issues/320)
2.  [Prototype profiler object serialization using
    JSON](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh/issues/343)
3.  [Design the sort and reorder algorithm in
    SimpleArray](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh/issues/435)

### training

If you are interested in the [modmesh
project](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh), but you are not familiar
with the project, we also have a training session for you, and you can
learn part of the following skills.

1.  Setting up and demonstrating modmesh.
2.  Basics of Git and GitHub.
3.  Writing Pybind11 and Unittest.
4.  Fundamentals of CMake, GNU Make, and GitHub Workflow.

## mini motorway simulator development

If you like the game [mini
motorway](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127500/Mini_Motorways/) ,
don\'t miss this session.

In this session, we will discuss the prototype of the simulator,
including:

1.  The random generator of the house and factory.
2.  The algorithm of the road building.
3.  The calculation of the traffic flow.

## free chat

In this session, you could discuss any topic you are interested in.
Additionally, we will discuss the following items to prepare the
upcoming events.

- Task arrangement for volunteers
- Promotion plan for upcoming events, including scisprint and next
  meetup
- The schedule of the projects

# About Meetup

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the
attendees, and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and
technology, which demand more critical discussions than other
applications of computer programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source
communities.

To join the meetup, please bring your laptop and [sign up](#sign-up).
Please [contact us](#contact-us) if you have any questions.
