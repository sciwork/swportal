## About Meetup

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source projects t
ogether. We welcome any subjects that may interest the attendees, and especiall
y encourage code for science, engineering, and technology, which demand more cr
itical discussions than other applications of computer programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all attendee
s to support more developers to join in the open-source communities.

To join the meetup, please bring your laptop and [sign up](#sign-up). Please [c
ontact us](#contact-us) if you have any questions.
