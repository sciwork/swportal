# Join the NASA TOPS Online Training!

We are excited to announce the upcoming collaboration between sciwork
and NASA TOPS online training, scheduled on 20th-21st August. This
training session is designed to introduce you to the skills for open
science.

After completing the [NASA Open Science Skills
Training](https://www.opensciencetraining.org/), participants will
receive a thank you email with a copy of the training materials. If the
participant attended and participated in both sessions, their
information will be shared with the NASA office to process the NASA Open
Science digital badge (\~90 days to process). We also invite
participants to follow us ([DUTC](https://www.dontusethiscode.com/)) on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dont-use-this-code/) and
forward our [open cohort registration
dates](https://www.opensciencetraining.org/) to those who they think may
be interested. You are welcome to join [the sciwork
community](https://sciwork.dev) for collaborations for scientific
programming. Say hi to us on [our discord
server](https://discord.gg/6MAkFrD).
