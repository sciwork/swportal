  scisprint"

In December 2023, sciwork hosted two event series, the weekly meetup and
the monthly Scisprint.

# Weekly Meetup

A lot of students from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University joined
the December meetups to discuss the courses they took and project
development. We did preparational work for sciwork 2023 conference and
the December Taipei scisprint. We also discussed how to automate the
flow for organizing sciwork events and the website deployment.

# Taipei Scisprint

It has been a while since the last time we held an event outside Taipei.
It is encouraging that the December Taipei Scisprint attracted five new
friends. It's the first time RockLeon hosted a scisprint, and he did an
excellent job at the new venue.

We are making good progress with the participating projects.
Participants with modmesh successfully installed the code on Windows,
showing the capability to deploy on multiple platforms. uTensor has
completed a Python wrapper for the C++ runtime using pybind11, which
already compiles and works on matrix multiplication.

PyLiteracy fixed a case problem and a logic bug in the Atlas project,
and added a new demo program. pydoc-zhtw has started translating many
new documents, including pathlib, pickletools, copyreg, io, and base64.
We also have started to build Weblate, an open source translation
platform to help more people get involved in translation.

This scisprint is also the beginning of the promotional plan for sciwork
events in 2024, including discussion of images and scheduling. Our
efforts over the past year made the preparation for the event smoother.
We are also constantly thinking about ways to further improve the
experience of the event and the website. There will be more and better
events in the new year.
