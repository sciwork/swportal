- Date: 11th March, Saturday, 2023
- Time: 10:00 -- 17:00 (7 hours)

To join the sprint, please bring your laptop and [sign up at
kktix](https://sciwork.kktix.cc/events/scisprint-202303-hsinchu). You
are also very welcome to bring your project, which should be added in
the [sprint note](#sprint-note) too. Please [contact us](#contact-us) if
you have any questions.

Scisprint is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the
attendees, and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and
technology, which demand more critical discussions than other
applications of computer programming.

In this sprint, we provide a [Training Room](#Training-Room) for the
newcomers/less experienced developers to get prepared to contribute in
the open-source projects.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source
communities.

### Training Room

The **command-line skills** are essential for a programmer. It is not
only cool, but also the key to develop software productively. During
this training room, [Mosky
Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moskyliu/?originalSubdomain=tw) will
teach some command-line skills and introduce some interesting topics
about it.

This training room will be like a workshop. There are some hands-on
practices for you to get familiar with the course. Let\'s have fun with
Mosky!

For more information, you could check it out in [project
list](https://hackmd.io/@sciwork/scisprint-2303#Projects). If you have
any questions, feel free to join [Discord](https://discord.gg/6MAkFrD)
