# Scisprint 2021 Early July: Python ZH TW Doc

This is the start of a series of sprints for translating [Python
official document](https://docs.python.org/3/) from English to
traditional Chinese (Taiwan; ZH TW locale). The agenda:

- Improve the review. Currently a bottleneck of the translation is the
  review by Adrian. It will be helpful to have more reviewers.
- Improve glossary. We have not had consistent translation of many
  English words. Find better ways to unify how terminology is
  translated.
- Automation and CI. We do not have any CI at the moment, but we
  should. We should check for build errors for each of the PRs, use of
  whites spaces, and daily update of source strings.
- Whether or not or how to use transifex. The keys are how to improve
  the pace of the translation, review, and integration of the current
  GitHub-based flow.

We are working on the 3.9 branch of the document:
[https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw/tree/3.9](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw/tree/3.9).
