## Scisprint 2021 Early September: Python ZH TW Doc

This is the third sprint for translating [Python official
document](https://docs.python.org/3/) from English to traditional
Chinese (Taiwan; ZH TW locale).

The agenda:

- Review and discuss about the previous [action
  items](https://hackmd.io/@sciwork/HyHIACNeK#Action-Items).
- **Pin-down roles & responsibilities**: We\'re in the process of
  restarting this project and seeking succeeding coordinator(s) and
  more reviewers. Need to make sure members are on the track.
- **Improve reviewing process**: Build workflow to accelerate
  reviewing process.
- **Improve glossary**: Unify how terminology is translated and expand
  the current glossary.
- **Automation and CI**: Establish pipelines for checking build errors
  and automating tedious tasks.

We are working on the 3.9 branch of the document:
