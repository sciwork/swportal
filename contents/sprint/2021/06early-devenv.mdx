## Scisprint 2021 Early of June: solvcon devenv

We cordially invite you to join the short sprint for the development
environment for [solvcon](https://solvcon.net/) projects.
[solvcon](https://solvcon.net/) is a host of projects focusing on
numerically solving the governing equations of transient phenomena.

The development environment, i.e., devenv (see [the github
page](https://github.com/solvcon/devenv)), is also a solvcon project,
but has a much broader scope that includes the infrastructure for
developing code for numerical calculations, which are the foundation of
computational sciences and mathematics. The real-world applications,
including physics, mechanics, semiconductor, finance, machine learning,
etc., will be built with it.

Numerical calculations require writing high-performance code. The
complex implementations call for tremendous amount of code to be written
and it is not possible to do it all by a single team. External
dependencies are necessary. However, because of the requirements of
accuracy and performance, the dependencies are usually at the source
level. Building dependencies from source is the norm. The project devenv
is made to help the source-level dependency management and alignment for
the runtime among developers.

### Registration

Please join
[gather.town](https://gather.town/app/yLTe8mBDb8pogMOX/sciwork) on the
day of sprint !!

### Date & time

05th June, Saturday, 2021, 15:00 -- 17:00

### Agenda

- **15:00 -- 15:30**: Opening, introduction for devenv and solvcon
- **15:30 -- 16:30**: Let\'s build solvcon with devenv
- **16:30 -- 17:00**: Discussion

### Requirements

We will need you to have a laptop or a VM running either MacOS or Linux.
At the moment the project does not yet support Windows.

This time we hold the sprint on the
[gather.town](https://gather.town/app/yLTe8mBDb8pogMOX/sciwork) and
suggest to use laptop or personal computer instead of mobile device such
like iPad or iPhone etc\...
