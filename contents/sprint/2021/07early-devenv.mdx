## Scisprint 2021 Early July: solvcon devenv

We cordially invite you to join the short sprint for the development
environment for [solvcon](https://solvcon.net/) projects.
[solvcon](https://solvcon.net/) is a host of projects focusing on
numerically solving the governing equations of transient phenomena.

The development environment, i.e., devenv (see [the github
page](https://github.com/solvcon/devenv)), is also a solvcon project,
but has a much broader scope that includes the infrastructure for
developing code for numerical calculations, which are the foundation of
computational sciences and mathematics. The real-world applications,
including physics, mechanics, semiconductor, finance, machine learning,
etc., will be built with it.

Numerical calculations require writing high-performance code. The
complex implementations call for tremendous amount of code to be written
and it is not possible to do it all by a single team. External
dependencies are necessary. However, because of the requirements of
accuracy and performance, the dependencies are usually at the source
level. Building dependencies from source is the norm. The project devenv
is made to help the source-level dependency management and alignment for
the runtime among developers.

### Registration

Please join
[gather.town](https://gather.town/app/yLTe8mBDb8pogMOX/sciwork) on the
day of sprint !!

### Date & time

12th July, Monday, 2021, 19:00 -- 21:00

### Agenda

A system needs to be well tested before it is reliable and easy to
maintain. In this sprint we will improve the reliability of devenv by
adding more test cases!

- **19:00 -- 19:30**: Opening, introduction for devenv and solvcon
- **19:30 -- 20:30**: Add more **test cases!!**
- **20:30 -- 21:00**: Discussion

### Requirements

You will need a laptop or VM running either MacOS or Linux. At the
moment the project does not yet support Windows.

We hold the sprint on the
[gather.town](https://gather.town/app/yLTe8mBDb8pogMOX/sciwork).
Connection from a laptop or desktop is recommended. Mobile devices
(iPad, iPhone, etc.) do not perform well with
[gather.town](https://gather.town/app/yLTe8mBDb8pogMOX/sciwork).
