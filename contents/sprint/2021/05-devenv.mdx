# Scisprint 2021 May: solvcon devenv

We cordially invite you to join the short sprint for the development
environment for [solvcon](https://solvcon.net/) projects.
[solvcon](https://solvcon.net/) is a host of projects focusing on
numerically solving the governing equations of transient phenomena.

The development environment, i.e., devenv (see [the github
page](https://github.com/solvcon/devenv)), is also a solvcon project,
but has a much broader scope that includes the infrastructure for
developing code for numerical calculations, which are the foundation of
computational sciences and mathematics. The real-world applications,
including physics, mechanics, semiconductor, finance, machine learning,
etc., will be built with it.

Numerical calculations require writing high-performance code. The
complex implementations call for tremendous amount of code to be written
and it is not possible to do it all by a single team. External
dependencies are necessary. However, because of the requirements of
accuracy and performance, the dependencies are usually at the source
level. Building dependencies from source is the norm. The project devenv
is made to help the source-level dependency management and alignment for
the runtime among developers.

## Registration

Please RSVP at:
[https://taichung-py.kktix.cc/events/meetup-202105-startingfromsource](https://taichung-py.kktix.cc/events/meetup-202105-startingfromsource)

## Date & time

8th May, Saturday, 2021, 10:30am \-- 12:00pm

It follows the Taichung.py talk that introduces the development of the
development environment!

## Agenda

- (10:00 \-- 10:30: Taichung.py devenv talk)
- **10:30 \-- 10:45**: What are sciwork sprints
- **10:45 \-- 11:00**: Project information of solvcon devenv
- **11:00 \-- 12:00**: Simple sprint for solvcon devenv

## Requirements
