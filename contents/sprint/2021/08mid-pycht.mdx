# Scisprint 2021 Mid-August: Python ZH TW Doc

This is the second sprint for for translating [Python official
document](https://docs.python.org/3/) from English to traditional
Chinese (Taiwan; ZH TW locale).

The agenda:

- Improve the project scheduling. Currently, this project is calling
  for the coordinator, and no one is available for review. We should
  re-planning the jobs in this project. Please feel free to share your
  opinions about the work in the project like the thoughts about the
  review workflow, translation work scheduling, etc.
- Improve the review. We are facing the bottleneck of translation for
  reviewing, and the review process is not efficient. We need to
  improve the review process including building a review workflow or
  mechanism.
- Improve glossary. We have not had consistent translation of many
  English words. Find better ways to unify how terminology is
  translated.
- Automation and CI. We do not have any CI at the moment, but we
  should. We should check for build errors for each of the PRs, use of
  whites spaces, and daily update of source strings.
- Review and discussion about previous [action
  items](https://hackmd.io/a-gzVVMJSjumLdpVwcZ21Q?view#Action-items).

We are working on the 3.9 branch of the document:
[https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw/tree/3.9](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw/tree/3.9).
