## Scisprint 2021 Late November in Taipei

We cordially invite you to join the short sprint for
[solvcon](https://solvcon.net/) projects.
[solvcon](https://solvcon.net/) is a host of projects focusing on
numerically solving the governing equations of transient phenomena.
There will be two projects in [solvcon](https://solvcon.net/) and we
will not assume you to have the domain knowledge. We welcome everyone
having basic skills in Unix programming.

### solvcon projects

This event will focus on two projects in solvcon:

- The development environment
  [devenv](https://github.com/solvcon/devenv). It supports the
  development of other solvcon projects by providing an infrastructure
  of building the third-party dependencies from source.

  Numerical calculations require writing high-performance code. The
  complex implementations call for tremendous amount of code to be
  written and it is not possible to do it all by a single team.
  External dependencies are necessary. However, because of the
  requirements of accuracy and performance, the dependencies are
  usually at the source level. Building dependencies from source is
  the norm. The project devenv is made to help the source-level
  dependency management and alignment for the runtime among
  developers.

- Mesh module [modmesh](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh). It is a
  C++-11 library wrapped using
  [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for the
  spatial mesh for [the space-time conservation element and solution
  element (CESE)
  method](https://yyc.solvcon.net/en/latest/cese/index.html).

### swportal

In addition to solvcon projects, we will also spend time to improve the
[sciwork website](https://sciwork.dev):
[https://github.com/sciwork/swportal](https://github.com/sciwork/swportal).

### Registration

Add your name in the [sprint
notes](https://hackmd.io/@sciwork/r1Q6c9lvK) and Go to our discord
channel [https://discord.gg/P9U7PFv](https://discord.gg/P9U7PFv) to say hi to us.

The event is free, but you need to make at least an order (for coffee or
something) at Old Major Coffee (where we meet this time). Make two
orders, if you can.

Please sign up using a name that we can identify you, and introduce
yourself when you show up.

### Date & time

20th November, Saturday, 2021, 14:00 -- 16:00

### Agenda

There is not really an agenda. We will just be there and code. You will
like it.

### Requirements

You will need a laptop or VM running either MacOS or Linux. At the
moment the project does not yet support Windows.
