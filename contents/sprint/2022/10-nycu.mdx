# Sciwork Meetup October 2022 in NYCU

Date: 14th October, Friday, 2022

Computers have eaten the world but it did not come from vacuum. We rely
so heavily on computer programming because the software developed solves
so many problems. The versatile applications are the reason that
everyone is encouraged to learn programming.

But there are differences between programming for work and for fun.
Classrooms cannot provide everything needed to develop a professional
career for coding. In the sciwork meetup, we will use a program
combining a panel discussion and [hands-on coding
sprints](#sprint-projects-and-requirements) to provide practical points
of view to writing code for work.

Sciwork hosted [a panel discussion in
May](https://sciwork.dev/sprint/2022/05-nycu-career). The panel
discussion in this meetup will feature the same theme, but bring new
perspectives from different [Panelists](#panelists).

You can join both the panel and the sprint or either of them. See [Sign
Up](#sign-up), and more information is available in the hackmd note:
