# Open, Free, and Balanced Software Career: a Panel Discussion

You are cordially invited to the sciwork joint event of career panel and
project sprint. It will feature the discussions with experienced
software developers in the vibrant industries. The
[Panelists](#panelists) will provide insightful information and hands-on
experience for how professional software development works globally and
locally. Your questions are also welcomed.

The panel discussions will be especially helpful to those who are
seeking a professional career in the technology sectors. Software is a
central piece to move forward the civilization and it is of utmost
importance to invest in the development. As individuals, a key question
is whether or not a career in software is a suitable one, and if it is,
how to pursue it? We will discuss these questions from different facets.

After the panel discussions we will have the usual sprints. You can join
both the panel and the sprint or either of them. Put your name and
contact in the hackmd document ([Sign Up](#sign-up)). Online discussions
are available at [https://discord.gg/6MAkFrD](https://discord.gg/6MAkFrD) .

## 座談會：開放、自由與平衡的軟體職涯

誠摯邀請你來參加 sciwork 職涯座談與專案衝刺 (sprint)
二合一活動。我們將邀請資歷豐富的專業人士 (見
[Panelists](#panelists))，依據本地化的視角提供全球性的軟體產業經驗。希望能夠幫助你進入科技領域，也歡迎你前來提問。軟體是現代文明的發展中心，也是重要的投資。在決定踏入相關領域之前，最好能夠儘早了解個人的適性與發展方向。

座談會之後還有慣例的專案衝刺活動。你可以選擇參加其中一個活動，或者兩個都參加。請在活動的
hackmd 文件 ([Sign Up](#sign-up)) 中登記你的名字 (本名或任何稱呼均可)

## Perks

To every attendee of the career panel, our sponsor
[Droidtown](https://www.droidtown.co/) will provide a coupon code of
their product [CV-Scanner](https://cvscanner.droidtown.co) for one month
of full-function trial.

[CV-Scanner](https://cvscanner.droidtown.co) is implemented with
insights from professional HR and opinions from Tech. Company\'s
high-end managers. It uses NLP AI to parse your autobiography and give
suggestions to help compose an informative autobiography. The items
CV-Scanner checks are the **most-want-to-know** information to HR and
programming team leaders. Our research shows that experienced manager
tend to ignored template-based texts for they cannot see the
candidates\' narrative logic from the texts. Unlike most template
CV/Autobiography tools that erase one\'s writing style, CV-Scanner keeps
job seekers\' writing style to help the HR identify talents with better
sense.

[CV-Scanner](https://cvscanner.droidtown.co)
是在實地參訪人資主管的專業洞見和科技公司高階經理對召募人員的想法後，實作而成的寫作輔助平台。自然語言處理
AI
將自動解析您的自傳內容並給予建議以便輔助求職者編寫更完整且豐富的自傳內容。CV-Scanner
的解析功能，將會檢查人資部門以及軟體工程部門主管\*\*最想看\*\*的項目，並給予建議。我們的研究中發現有經驗的經理人傾向略過明顯基於範本的自傳，因為千篇一律的範本使他們無法從文字中確認求職者的敘事邏輯是否清楚。因此，和大部份履歷/自傳範本不同的是，CV-Scanner
保留您的撰寫風格以供用人單位辨別求職者是否具備清晰思維。
