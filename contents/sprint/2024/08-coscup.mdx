# About scisprint @ COSCUP

We will host a scisprint in [COSCUP](https://coscup.org/2024/zh-TW/). In
this event, it will include a [hacking session](#hacking-session),
[career roundtable](#career-roundtable) and [technical
talks](#technical-talks).

To join the sprint, please bring your laptop. You are also very welcome
to bring your project. Please [contact us](#contact-us) if you have any
questions.

Scisprint, hosted by the sciwork community, is a monthly coding sprint.
It would like to facilitate discussions and exchanges among people in
the fields of science, numerical computation, and engineering.
Participants, regardless of experience level, can gain valuable
development insights in this event.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source
communities.

# Hacking Session

It aims to encourage collaboration and interaction among developers
through project participation. The projects cover various fields,
including but not limited to science, numerical computation, and
engineering. You are also encouraged to share your own projects in
scisprint. Refer to [project list](#project-list) below for more
details.

## Project List

### modmesh

- **Related Subjects:** Python, C++, PDE
- **Project Link:** [Github](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh)
- **Project Contact:** Yung-Yu Chen (discord: \@yyc#7718)

modmesh seamlessly mixes C++ and Python through pybind11, allowing you
to leverage the strengths of both programming languages for efficient
PDE solving. We use Qt and Python to visualize the computation results
to give you a better understanding of your PDE solution. modmesh also
supports mesh visualization, currently in the Gmsh mesh file format. We
have recently made efforts to improve the modmesh UI/UX.

The design allows it to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Everyone can
use or contribute to modmesh.

### uTensor

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/uTensor/uTensor)
- **Project Contact:** Dboy(discord: \@dboyliao#1295)

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework
built on C++11. It simplifies model deployment by seamlessly converting
TensorFlow-trained models into efficient C++ files that can be used to
infer on the embedding device and integrate with optimized libraries
such as CMSIS-NN by ARM with ease. Compared with the binary files, C++
source code will provide greater flexibility to modify the trained model
for the embedding engineers.

We provide the defaults for tensors, operators, and memory allocation.
Just like the booming development of machine learning, we are also
actively developing the above functions. Welcome to join us.

### sciwork portal

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/sciwork/swportal)
- **Project Contact:** Aya yu (discord: \@tN#6722), Chester (discord:
  \@chester), Wuxian (discord: \@5x9527)

Sciwork Portal is a project for maintaining our official website -
Sciwork.dev, which was built by Pelican with tailwindCSS, and deployed
by Netfliy. We create the promotional pages for meetup and sprint
events. Our team also maintains the sciwork conference page -
conf.sciwork.dev.

We have always been actively trying to provide users a better web
browsing experience, including information presentation and visual
experience. Welcome to join us if you are interested in website
maintence.

### pydoccht

- **Project Link:**
  [Github](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw)
- **Project Contact:** Matt Wang (@mattwang44), Josix (@Josix#3800)

Our primary mission is to make Python\'s official documentation
accessible to the Traditional Chinese audience by providing accurate and
comprehensive translations. Whether you are a seasoned Python developer
or a language expert, we welcome individuals who are enthusiastic about
Python and passionate about making knowledge accessible to all.

### pyLiteracy

- **Project Link:**
  [GitHub](https://github.com/Chenct-jonathan/Loc_zai_and_Rep_zai_parser)
- **Project Contact:** Jonathan Chen (discord: \@陳畯田), PeterWolf
  (discord: \@PeterWolf#1422)

Mandarin grammar parser based on syntactical context. By analyzing and
simplifying the structures of correct usages into code instructions,
provide a linguistics-based model to accomplish efficient Mandarin
grammar checking tasks with minimal resources.

### Commitizen-Tools

- **Project Link:**
  [GitHub](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen)
- Project Contact: Wei Lee (discord: \@clleew#6749)

Commitizen-tools allows teams to effectively implement version control
that conforms to the specified rules. It uses interactive forms to
create commit messages that meet conventional commits rules. It also
bumps versions automatically using Semantic Versioning and generates a
changelog using Keep a Changelog.

In addition, you can also customize your own rules to suit your team.
Commitizen-tools is a widely used tool in many communities. We still
have a lot of issues to fix and develop. Welcome to join us.

# Career Roundtable

Career roundtable is to have a relaxed discussions with experienced
software professionals. At this time, we invited many professional
software engineers as our mentor. If you have career-related questions
or seek for some guidances, do not miss out this chance!
