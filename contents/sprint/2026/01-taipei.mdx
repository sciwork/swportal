## About the Scisprint

To join the sprint, please bring your laptop and [sign up](#sign-up).
You are also very welcome to bring your project. Please [contact
us](#contact-us) if you have any questions.

Scisprint, hosted by the sciwork community, is a monthly coding sprint.
It would like to facilitate discussions and exchanges among people in
the fields of science, numerical computation, and engineering.
Participants, regardless of experience level, can gain valuable
development insights in this event.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source
communities.

## Coding Session

It aims to encourage collaboration and interaction among developers
through project participation. The projects cover various fields,
including but not limited to science, numerical computation, and
engineering. You are also encouraged to share your own projects in
scisprint. Refer to [project list](#project-list) below for more
details.

## Project List

### modmesh

- **Related Subjects:** Python, C++, PDE
- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh)
- **Project Contact:** Yung-Yu Chen (discord: \@yyc#7718)

modmesh seamlessly mixes C++ and Python through pybind11, allowing you
to leverage the strengths of both programming languages for efficient
PDE solving. We use Qt and Python to visualize the computation results
to give you a better understanding of your PDE solution. modmesh also
supports mesh visualization, currently in the Gmsh mesh file format. We
have recently made efforts to improve the modmesh UI/UX.

The design allows it to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Everyone can
use or contribute to modmesh.

### sciwork portal

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/sciwork/swportal)
- **Project Contact:** Chester (discord: \@chester), Wuxian (discord:
  \@5x9527), Steve Chen (discord: \@Steve Chen)

sciwork Portal maintains the official website, sciwork.dev,
and related event pages, including conf.sciwork.dev.
Built with Next.js and TailwindCSS, it offers promotional
pages for meetups and sprint events. 

Our team is dedicated to enhancing user experience
 through better information presentation and visuals.

### Cyntx

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cytnx-dev/Cytnx)
- **Project Contact:** Alex Chiang (discord: \@alexchiang_60942)

Cytnx (pronounced as sci-tens) is a tensor network library designed for
classical/quantum physics simulations. It supports C++ and Python with
almost identical interface and syntax, such that users can effortlessly
switch between the two languages. Aiming at a quick learning process for
new users of tensor network algorithms, the interfaces resemble the
popular scientific libraries such as numpy, Scipy, and PyTorch.
Symmetries present in physical systems can be easily defined and
implemented in tensors.In addition, we provide a useful class called
Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform the
contractions in an optimal order that can be automatically computed.

There are still many physics applications and GPU support backend being
developed. Welcome to join us to contribute to Cytnx.

#### Pydoc-zhtw

- **Project Link:** [Github](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw)
- **Project Contact:** Matt Wang (@mattwang44), Josix (@Josix#3800)

Our primary mission is to make Python\'s official documentation
accessible to the Traditional Chinese audience by providing accurate and
comprehensive translations. Whether you are a seasoned Python developer
or a language expert, we welcome individuals who are enthusiastic about
Python and passionate about making knowledge accessible to all.

#### Commitizen-Tools

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen)
- Project Contact: Wei Lee (discord: \@clleew#6749)

Commitizen-tools allows teams to effectively implement version control
that conforms to the specified rules. It uses interactive forms to
create commit messages that meet conventional commits rules. It also
bumps versions automatically using Semantic Versioning and generates a
changelog using Keep a Changelog.

In addition, you can also customize your own rules to suit your team.
Commitizen-tools is a widely used tool in many communities. We still
have a lot of issues to fix and develop. Welcome to join us.
