## About the scisprint

To join the sprint, please bring your laptop and [sign up](#sign-up).
You are also very welcome to bring your project. Please [contact
us](#contact-us) if you have any questions.

scisprint, hosted by the sciwork community, is a monthly coding sprint.
It would like to facilitate discussions and exchanges among people in
the fields of science, numerical computation, and engineering.
Participants, regardless of experience level, can gain valuable
development insights in this event.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source
communities.

## Hacking Session

It aims to encourage collaboration and interaction among developers
through project participation. The projects cover various fields,
including but not limited to science, numerical computation, and
engineering. You are also encouraged to share your own projects in
scisprint. Refer to [project list](#project-list) below for more
details.

## Project List

### modmesh

- **Related Subjects:** Python, C++, PDE
- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh)
- **Project Contact:** Yung-Yu Chen (discord: \@yyc#7718)

Toolkit for solving partial differential equations and visulizing the
numerical results. modmesh seamlessly mixes C++ and Python through
**pybind11**, using Qt and Python to visualize the computation results
to give you a better understanding of your PDE solution

### AItlas

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Droidtown/AItlas)
- **Project Contact:** PeterWolf (discord: \@PeterWolf#1422),
  [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tYq4qUY4)

A knowledge graph should formally represent relations between/among
entities and provide insights for semantic computation in natural
language understanding (NLU). The representation is usually like a net
2D or atlas in 3D and higher dimensions. In recent years, this is
usually called RAG. We believe a knowledge graph (thus KG) can do more
for AI, thus named our project AI+Atlas = AItlas.

### sciwork portal

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/sciwork/swportal)
- **Project Contact:** Chester (discord: \@chester), Wuxian (discord:
  \@5x9527)

sciwork Portal is a project for maintaining our official website --
sciwork.dev, which was built by Pelican with tailwindCSS, and deployed
by Netlify. We have always been actively trying to provide users a
better web browsing experience, including information presentation and
visual experience. Welcome to join us if you are interested in website
maintence.

### pydoc-zhtw

- **Project Link:**
  [GitHub](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw)
- **Project Contact:** Matt Wang (@mattwang44), Josix (@Josix#3800)

Our primary mission is to make **Python\'s official documentation**
accessible to the **Traditional Chinese** audience by providing accurate
and comprehensive translations. Whether you are a seasoned Python
developer or a language expert, we welcome individuals who are
enthusiastic about Python and passionate about making knowledge
accessible to all.
