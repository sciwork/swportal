# About the Scisprint

To join the sprint, please bring your laptop and [sign up](#sign-up).
You are also very welcome to bring your project. Please [contact
us](#contact-us) if you have any questions.

Scisprint, hosted by the sciwork community, is a monthly coding sprint.
It would like to facilitate discussions and exchanges among people in
the fields of science, numerical computation, and engineering.
Participants, regardless of experience level, can gain valuable
development insights in this event.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source
communities.

# Hacking Session

It aims to encourage collaboration and interaction among developers
through project participation. The projects cover various fields,
including but not limited to science, numerical computation, and
engineering. You are also encouraged to share your own projects in
scisprint. Refer to [project list](#project-list) below for more
details.

## Project List

### modmesh

- **Related Subjects:** Python, C++, PDE
- **Project Link:** [Github](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh)
- **Project Contact:** Yung-Yu Chen (discord: \@yyc#7718)

modmesh seamlessly mixes C++ and Python through pybind11, allowing you
to leverage the strengths of both programming languages for efficient
PDE solving. We use Qt and Python to visualize the computation results
to give you a better understanding of your PDE solution. modmesh also
supports mesh visualization, currently in the Gmsh mesh file format. We
have recently made efforts to improve the modmesh UI/UX.

The design allows it to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Everyone can
use or contribute to modmesh.

### uTensor

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/uTensor/uTensor)
- **Project Contact:** Dboy(discord: \@dboyliao#1295)

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework
built on C++11. It simplifies model deployment by seamlessly converting
TensorFlow-trained models into efficient C++ files that can be used to
infer on the embedding device and integrate with optimized libraries
such as CMSIS-NN by ARM with ease. Compared with the binary files, C++
source code will provide greater flexibility to modify the trained model
for the embedding engineers.

We provide the defaults for tensors, operators, and memory allocation.
Just like the booming development of machine learning, we are also
actively developing the above functions. Welcome to join us.

### sciwork portal

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/sciwork/swportal)
- **Project Contact:** Chester (discord: \@chester), Wuxian (discord:
  \@5x9527), Steve Chen (discord: \@Steve Chen)

Sciwork Portal is a project for maintaining our official website -
Sciwork.dev, which was built by Pelican with tailwindCSS, and deployed
by Netfliy. We create the promotional pages for meetup and sprint
events. Our team also maintains the sciwork conference page -
conf.sciwork.dev.

We have always been actively trying to provide users a better web
browsing experience, including information presentation and visual
experience. Welcome to join us if you are interested in website
maintence.

### Cyntx

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cytnx-dev/Cytnx)
- **Project Contact:** Alex Chiang (discord: \@alexchiang_60942)

Cytnx (pronounced as sci-tens) is a tensor network library designed for
classical/quantum physics simulations. It supports C++ and Python with
almost identical interface and syntax, such that users can effortlessly
switch between the two languages. Aiming at a quick learning process for
new users of tensor network algorithms, the interfaces resemble the
popular scientific libraries such as numpy, Scipy, and PyTorch.
Symmetries present in physical systems can be easily defined and
implemented in tensors.In addition, we provide a useful class called
Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform the
contractions in an optimal order that can be automatically computed.

There are still many physics applications and GPU support backend being
developed. Welcome to join us to contribute to Cytnx.

### AItlas

- **Project Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Droidtown/AItlas)
- **Project Contact:** PeterWolf (discord: \@PeterWolf#1422),
  [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tYq4qUY4)

A knowledge graph should formally represent relations between/among
entities and provide insights for semantic computation in natural
language understanding (NLU). The representation is usually like a net
2D or atlas in 3D and higher dimensions. In recent years, this is
usually called RAG. We believe a knowledge graph (thus KG) can do more
for AI, thus named our project AI+Atlas = AItlas.
