# Scisprint 2020 August: uTensor

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework
built on TensorFlow and optimized for Arm targets. It consists of a
runtime library and an offline tool that handles most of the model
translation work. This repo holds the core runtime and some example
implementations of operators, memory managers/schedulers, and more, and
the size of the core runtime is only \~2KB!

The project repository is at [http://utensor.ai/](http://utensor.ai/). We cordially invite
everyone who's interested in machine learning and edge computing to join
us hacking uTensor.

## Registration

Please visit [https://sciwork.kktix.cc/events/scisprint20aug](https://sciwork.kktix.cc/events/scisprint20aug) to sign
up. Seats are limited to 25.

## Date & time

29th August, Saturday, 2020, 1:30pm \-- 4:30pm

## Agenda

- **1:30pm \-- 2:15pm**: System / environment setup for
  TinyML/Embedded ML development
- **2:15pm \-- 2:45pm**: Hello-World - Neural Network [Getting-Started
  Information](https://github.com/uTensor/utensor-helloworld)
- **2:45pm \-- 4:30pm**: Custom Graph Engine (Python) & Runtime
  Operators (C++)
- **4:30pm \--**: Free time for networking, dinner, after party

## Software Requirements

The audience are expected to bring their own computers. The software
requirements are:

- Python 3.5 and above. The development tool chain is moving toward
  [TensorFlow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), which does not
  support Python below 3.5.
- Unix(-like) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
  if running on Windows. uTensor does not fully support Windows yet
  and may not build on it.

The development team will guide the audience to set up the development
environment. But is is not practical to take every configuration into
account. We would love to hear your opinions about setting up the
environment. Please join the `#utensor` channel on our [discord
server](https://discord.gg/YVtXYSs). If you need help or have questions,
let us know.
