modmesh seamlessly mixes C++ and Python through pybind11, allowing you
to leverage the strengths of both programming languages for efficient
PDE solving. We use Qt and Python to visualize the computation results
to give you a better understanding of your PDE solution. modmesh also
supports mesh visualization, currently in the Gmsh mesh file format. We
have recently made efforts to improve the modmesh UI/UX.

The design allows it to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Everyone can
use or contribute to modmesh.

We are a passionate and dedicated volunteer group committed to bridging
the language gap in the Python community. Our primary mission is to make
Python\'s official documentation accessible to the Traditional Chinese
audience by providing accurate and comprehensive translations. Whether
you are a seasoned Python developer or a language expert, we welcome
individuals who are enthusiastic about Python and passionate about
making knowledge accessible to all. Come join us in our monthly meetups
where we share insights, discuss translation challenges, and build a
collaborative community together!

# sciwork portal

- **Project Contact:** Aya yu (discord: \@tN#6722), Chester (discord:
  \@chester), Wuxian (discord: \@5x9527)

Sciwork Portal is a project for maintaining our official website -
Sciwork.dev, which was built by Pelican with tailwindCSS, and deployed
by Netfliy. We create the promotional pages for meetup and sprint
events. Our team also maintains the sciwork conference page -
conf.sciwork.dev.

We have always been actively trying to provide users a better web
browsing experience, including information presentation and visual
experience. Welcome to join us if you are interested in website
maintence.

Common errors such as the misuse of synonyms and homophones are
prevalent for both native and non-native Taiwan Mandarin users. This
issue is indirectly attributed to the fact that large language models
(LLMs) trained on data primarily sourced from the internet struggle to
play a reliable role in Mandarin grammar checking tasks. Moreover, the
token-by-token and linear training process of the LLMs cannot provide
valid knowledge based on a thorough understanding of the non-linear
structure of human language. However, from a linguistic perspective,
training a model solely based on a mass amount of data is not the most
direct solution. In reality, such errors are directly related to the
non-linear structures of word classes and phrase structures. By
analyzing and simplifying the structures of correct usages into code
instructions, a linguistics-based model can effectively grasp the use of
language in a manner similar to human native speakers. This enables the
model to accomplish efficient Mandarin grammar checking tasks with
minimal resources.

# uTensor

- **Project Contact:** Dboy(discord: \@dboyliao#1295)

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework
built on C++11. It simplifies model deployment by seamlessly converting
TensorFlow-trained models into efficient C++ files that can be used to
infer on the embedding device and integrate with optimized libraries
such as CMSIS-NN by ARM with ease. Compared with the binary files, C++
source code will provide greater flexibility to modify the trained model
for the embedding engineers.

We provide the defaults for tensors, operators, and memory allocation.
Just like the booming development of machine learning, we are also
actively developing the above functions. Welcome to join us.

# Cytnx

- **Project Contact:** Lin Chang Teng (discord: \@jeffry1829#0568), Ke
  Hsu (discord: \@kjjjjjjjjj1104#5128)

Cytnx (pronounced as sci-tens) is a tensor network library designed for
classical/quantum physics simulations. It supports C++ and Python with
almost identical interface and syntax, such that users can effortlessly
switch between the two languages. Aiming at a quick learning process for
new users of tensor network algorithms, the interfaces resemble the
popular scientific libraries such as numpy, Scipy, and PyTorch.
Symmetries present in physical systems can be easily defined and
implemented in tensors. In addition, we provide a useful class called
Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform the
contractions in an optimal order that can be automatically computed.

There are still many physics applications and GPU support backend being
developed. Welcome to join us to contribute to Cytnx.

# Commitizen-Tools

- **Project Link:**
  [GitHub](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen)
- **Project Contact:** Wei Lee (discord: \@clleew#6749)

Commitizen-tools allows teams to effectively implement version control
that conforms to the specified rules. It uses interactive forms to
create commit messages that meet conventional commits rules. It also
bumps versions automatically using Semantic Versioning and generates a
changelog using Keep a Changelog.

In addition, you can also customize your own rules to suit your team.
Commitizen-tools is a widely used tool in many communities. We still
have a lot of issues to fix and develop. Welcome to join us.

**You can join the Discord group to discuss the project.**
