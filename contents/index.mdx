<h2 className="text-center">About sciwork</h2>

sciwork is a community for researchers and engineers to share and
discuss computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work.
We believe in the power of openness, and use open source as a means to
advance software development for computational sciences.

As information technology blending in every aspect of human activities,
proficient use of programming languages is a prerequisite for conducting
most research and engineering work. As the practitioners observed, the
work evolved into a hierarchy of skills that take years to acquire. We
need a thorough understanding of the problem to solve as well as the
mastery of computer programming to deliver reliable solution. It is
overly challenging since either of both is already complicated. Sciwork
would like to get involved in the global effort to solve the issue of
code development entangling with science and engineering.

Our activities include but are not limited to [coding sprints](sprint),
hands-on tutorials, and technical talks and
[conferences](https://conf.sciwork.dev/) (ex, sciwork 2023), on-line or
off-line. You are welcome to [join us](about.html)!
