## First conference for scientific programming

The first sciwork conference (Hsinchu, 9th-10th December 2023) brought
us a lot of fun! The conference focuses on connecting scientific
programming with practical applications.

We gathered to discuss subjects for scientific programming and its
applications. The 15 talks in the technical program included data
engineering and science, software engineering, array and tensor code
development, applications of large language models (LLM), natural
language processing, graphic user interface (GUI) for numerical
analysis, astrology, and image processing. It is hard to fully digest
the diversified subjects, but it is exciting to see how computer code
works for everything in science and engineering.

### Humble Data

We thank all the participants, including sponsors, volunteers, and
contributors. We especially appreciate NYCU CS department for their help
for the venue. The conference also went with the [Humble
Data](https://humbledata.org) workshop. The full list of the program is
available at [https://conf.sciwork.dev/2023/program](https://conf.sciwork.dev/2023/program).

### Scientific Programming

The community of sciwork focuses on scientific programming, which is a
less visible area. Electronic computers were invented for engineering
purposes, and programming for science and engineering is not only
important for solving the problems, but also leads to advances to
computing itself. Although the rewards are huge, it does take a lot of
effort to get into the business of scientific software development.

</figure>

That is why the community is very encouraged by having 72 people in the
event. It is a great success to have so many enthusiastic participants
in the first conference. The speakers and staff generated rich content
for all attendees. People didn't simply listen. Good discussions
happened during the sessions as well as outside the conference room.

### Social Function

A conference cannot be a good one without the social time. Code can be
written alone. (In most of the time of development, code should be
written alone, undisturbed, for the quality we want.) But a good idea is
rarely summoned to a bathtub. Give a group of people a comfortable place
to talk and well-prepared topics, new ideas will be generated through
the vibrant discussions. The community of sciwork will keep making the
discussions happen. The conference is a start and a good example. The
organizers are already planning for the next steps.

### Technical Sharing

It would be unfair to say any of the talks is more exciting than others.
But it is probably fair to say that data engineering and science is a
major highlight of the conference. The technologies are used everywhere
around us, for daily grocery shopping to high-tech manufacturing.
Looking forward, sciwork continues to foster technical sharings and
collaborative projects in all fields. Our partnerships with
[PyData](https://pydata.org/) and [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/)
strengthen our commitment to advancing data science and engineering. We
will bring together a community of like-minded professionals to explore
the technical frontiers.

A related theme in the technical program is the array and tensor
libraries. Compact (contiguous-memory) arrays are essential to numerical
calculations and high-performance computing (HPC). Two of the projects,
[uTensor](https://github.com/uTensor/uTensor) and
[Cytnx](https://github.com/Cytnx-dev/Cytnx), shared their work with us.
Further development will be encouraging.

Another group of technical sharing was the work for solving partial
differential equations (PDE). It is a challenging problem and involves
work in multiple areas, including computational geometry, computational
mechanics, numerical methods, visualization, etc.

### Humble Data Workshop

One of the key highlights was [the Humble Data workshop led by Cheuk
Ting Ho](https://pretalx.sciwork.dev/sw23/speaker/KWN7UL/). This session
stood out for its focus on making data science accessible to a wider
audience, including beginners. Through the hands-on activities,
participants delved into real-world datasets with the guidance by data
experts. The workshop not only focused on practical skills in data
analysis but also fostered an inclusive environment for learning and
collaboration. Cheuk and many mentors brought valuable expertise to the
workshop, aligning perfectly with the sciwork mission of democratizing
programming knowledge and promoting community engagement

### More Code And Results

sciwork is a community for researchers and engineers to share and
discuss computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work.
We believe in the power of openness, and use open source as a means to
advance software development for computational sciences. sciwork will
continue to support the coding projects and promote more of them. If you
have any software development work seeking collaborators, please contact
us.

We are also planning for the events in the coming year (2024). If you
are interested in working with us in any form, please also let us know.

You can find our contact information at [https://sciwork.dev/about](https://sciwork.dev/about).
