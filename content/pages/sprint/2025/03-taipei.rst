About the scisprint
----------------------

To join the sprint, please bring your laptop and `sign up <#sign-up>`__.  You are also 
very welcome to bring your project. Please `contact us <#contact-us>`__ if you have any 
questions.

scisprint, hosted by the sciwork community, is a monthly coding sprint. It would like to 
facilitate discussions and exchanges among people in the fields of science, numerical 
computation, and engineering. Participants, regardless of experience level, can gain valuable 
development insights in this event.

.. This event includes a `hacking session <#hacking-session>`__ and `career conversation <#career-conversation>`__.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all attendees to support more developers
to join in the open-source communities. 

Hacking Session
------------------

It aims to encourage collaboration and interaction among developers through project 
participation. The projects cover various fields, including but not limited to science, 
numerical computation, and engineering. You are also encouraged to share your own projects 
in scisprint. Refer to `project list <#project-list>`__ below for more details.

Project List
---------------

modmesh
^^^^^^^^^

- **Related Subjects:** Python, C++, PDE
- **Project Link:** `GitHub <https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh>`__
- **Project Contact:** Yung-Yu Chen (discord: @yyc#7718)

Toolkit for solving partial differential equations and visulizing the numerical results. modmesh seamlessly 
mixes C++ and Python through **pybind11**, using Qt and Python to visualize the computation results to give 
you a better understanding of your PDE solution

AItlas
^^^^^^^

- **Project Link:** `GitHub <https://github.com/Droidtown/AItlas>`__
- **Project Contact:** PeterWolf (discord: @PeterWolf#1422), `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/tYq4qUY4>`__

A knowledge graph should formally represent relations between/among entities and provide insights for semantic 
computation in natural language understanding (NLU). The representation is usually like a net 2D or atlas in 3D 
and higher dimensions. In recent years, this is usually called RAG. We believe a knowledge graph (thus KG) can 
do more for AI, thus named our project AI+Atlas = AItlas.

sciwork portal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Project Link:** `GitHub <https://github.com/sciwork/swportal>`__
- **Project Contact:** Aya yu (discord: @tN#6722), Chester (discord: @chester), Wuxian (discord: @5x9527)

sciwork Portal is a project for maintaining our official website – sciwork.dev, which was built by Pelican 
with tailwindCSS, and deployed by Netlify. We have always been actively trying to provide users a better web 
browsing experience, including information presentation and visual experience. Welcome to join us if you are 
interested in website maintence.

pydoc-zhtw
^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Project Link:** `GitHub <https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw>`__
- **Project Contact:** Matt Wang (@mattwang44), Josix (@Josix#3800)

Our primary mission is to make **Python's official documentation** accessible to the **Traditional Chinese** 
audience by providing accurate and comprehensive translations. Whether you are a seasoned Python developer or 
a language expert, we welcome individuals who are enthusiastic about Python and passionate about making 
knowledge accessible to all.
