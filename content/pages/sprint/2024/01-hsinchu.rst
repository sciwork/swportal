About the Scisprint
----------------------

To join the sprint, please bring your laptop and `sign up <#sign-up>`__.  You are also 
very welcome to bring your project. Please `contact us <#contact-us>`__ if you have any 
questions.

Scisprint, hosted by the sciwork community, is a monthly coding sprint. It would like to 
facilitate discussions and exchanges among people in the fields of science, numerical 
computation, and engineering. Participants, regardless of experience level, can gain valuable 
development insights in this event.

.. This event includes a `hacking session <#hacking-session>`__ and `career conversation <#career-conversation>`__.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all attendees to support more developers
to join in the open-source communities. 

Hacking Session
------------------

It aims to encourage collaboration and interaction among developers through project 
participation. The projects cover various fields, including but not limited to science, 
numerical computation, and engineering. You are also encouraged to share your own projects 
in scisprint. Refer to `project list <#project-list>`__ below for more details.

Project List
+++++++++++++

pyLiteracy
^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Project Link:** `GitHub <https://github.com/Chenct-jonathan/Loc_zai_and_Rep_zai_parser>`__
- **Project Contact:** Jonathan Chen (discord: @陳畯田), PeterWolf (discord: @PeterWolf#1422)

Common errors such as the misuse of synonyms and homophones are prevalent for both native and 
non-native Taiwan Mandarin users. This issue is indirectly attributed to the fact that large language 
models (LLMs) trained on data primarily sourced from the internet struggle to play a reliable role in 
Mandarin grammar checking tasks. Moreover, the token-by-token and linear training process of the LLMs 
cannot provide valid knowledge based on a thorough understanding of the non-linear structure of human 
language. However, from a linguistic perspective, training a model solely based on a mass amount of data 
is not the most direct solution. In reality, such errors are directly related to the non-linear structures 
of word classes and phrase structures. By analyzing and simplifying the structures of correct usages into 
code instructions, a linguistics-based model can effectively grasp the use of language in a manner similar 
to human native speakers. This enables the model to accomplish efficient Mandarin grammar checking tasks 
with minimal resources.

uTensor
^^^^^^^^

- **Project Link:** `GitHub <https://github.com/uTensor/uTensor>`__
- **Project Contact:** Dboy(discord: @dboyliao#1295)

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework built on C++11. It simplifies model 
deployment by seamlessly converting TensorFlow-trained models into efficient C++ files that can be used to infer 
on the embedding device and integrate with optimized libraries such as CMSIS-NN by ARM with ease. Compared with 
the binary files, C++ source code will provide greater flexibility to modify the trained model for the embedding engineers. 

We provide the defaults for tensors, operators, and memory allocation. Just like the booming development of 
machine learning, we are also actively developing the above functions. Welcome to join us.
