About the Seminar
----------------------

sciwork seminar is a one-day event to include technical talks, tutorials, and coding activities. 
The event is designed to include all angles for those who are interested in developing robust software 
for solving real-world problems regardless of the popularity of the applications. Because it is all-angle, 
the seminar aims at connecting highly motivated developers to junior practitioners, as well as prospective 
employers who have problems to be solved.

Technical Talks
------------------

Talks 1 : modmesh development: GUI for 1D Euler solution and devenv
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

modmesh is a toolkit for solving partial differential equations and visulizing the numerical results.
We'll show how we use a hybrid architecture (C++ and Python) for computational software. We will also share 
the experience of how we carry out data visualisation and GUI development.

Talks 2 : How does sciwork implement web development in CI/CD way?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this presentation we'll share the infrastructure of the sciwork web development. Discover why we 
choose Netlify as our development platform, explore the seamless integration with Github and demonstrate 
an efficient workflow for our project.

Tutorial feature engineering
------------------------------

Feature engineering is an essential step in building data models. It involves the capacity 
to understand domain knowledge and project requirements, as there's no one-size-fits-all approach. 
The focus is not on the validity of the model, but on repetitive analysis and targeted feature 
engineering to meet business requirements. This provides a deeper understanding of the principles and 
techniques involved in feature engineering.

The tutorial focuses on constructing predictive models for data. It provides a step-by-step guide on 
error analysis and demonstrates how to repetitive perform feature engineering based on the analysis 
results. This enables a gradual refinement and optimization of the model's validity in prediction and interpretation.

Coding Sprint
------------------

It aims to encourage collaboration and interaction among developers through project 
participation. The projects cover various fields, including but not limited to science, 
numerical computation, and engineering. You are also encouraged to share your own projects 
in scisprint. Refer to `project list <#project-list>`__ below for more details.
