(Cancelled due to COVID-19) Scisprint 2021 End of May: solvcon devenv
=====================================================================

.. warning::

  The event is cancelled because of the escalated COVID-19 situation in Taiwan.
  New schedule will be made after the health concerns are removed.

We cordially invite you to join the short sprint for the development
environment for `solvcon <https://solvcon.net/>`_ projects.  solvcon_ is a host
of projects focusing on numerically solving the governing equations of
transient phenomena.

The development environment, i.e., devenv (see `the github page
<https://github.com/solvcon/devenv>`__), is also a solvcon project, but has a
much broader scope that includes the infrastructure for developing code for
numerical calculations, which are the foundation of computational sciences and
mathematics.  The real-world applications, including physics, mechanics,
semiconductor, finance, machine learning, etc., will be built with it.

Numerical calculations require writing high-performance code.  The complex
implementations call for tremendous amount of code to be written and it is not
possible to do it all by a single team.  External dependencies are necessary.
However, because of the requirements of accuracy and performance, the
dependencies are usually at the source level.  Building dependencies from
source is the norm.  The project devenv is made to help the source-level
dependency management and alignment for the runtime among developers.
