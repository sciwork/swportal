Scisprint 2021 Mid-August: Python ZH TW Doc
=================================================

This is the second sprint for for translating `Python official
document <https://docs.python.org/3/>`__ from English to traditional Chinese
(Taiwan; ZH TW locale).

The agenda:

* Improve the project scheduling. Currently, this project is calling for 
  the coordinator, and no one is available for review. We should re-planning
  the jobs in this project. Please feel free to share your opinions about the
  work in the project like the thoughts about the review workflow, 
  translation work scheduling, etc. 

* Improve the review. We are facing the bottleneck of translation for
  reviewing, and the review process is not efficient. We need to improve the review
  process including building a review workflow or mechanism.

* Improve glossary.  We have not had consistent translation of many English
  words. Find better ways to unify how terminology is translated.

* Automation and CI.  We do not have any CI at the moment, but we should.  We
  should check for build errors for each of the PRs, use of whites spaces, and
  daily update of source strings.

* Review and discussion about previous `action items <https://hackmd.io/a-gzVVMJSjumLdpVwcZ21Q?view#Action-items>`_.

We are working on the 3.9 branch of the document:
https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw/tree/3.9.
