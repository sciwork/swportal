Scisprint 2021 August
=====================

Scisprint is an event gathering people who want to write code for specific
projects.  In the August event, there are the following projects:

* SOLVCON development environment (devenv) https://github.com/solvcon/devenv:
  This project is a set of (Bourne again) shell scripts to align the
  environment for developing `SOLVCON <https://github.com/solvcon>`__ and
  related projects in (Ubuntu) Linux and macOS.
* Automation bot for sciwork discord server https://discord.gg/6MAkFrD .  There
  is not an automated flow for sciwork events.  The event data are added and
  maintained manually through https://github.com/sciwork/swportal, the
  repository of the community web site https://sciwork.dev/ .
* Python-C/C++ Bindgen https://hackmd.io/@vy0m6Zc7Q0WJ0aMT6NdBzw/rySh6Lket:
  This project aim to automatically generate C/C++ structure memory layout at
  compile-time (setup.py) and used in Python to align binary data back
  to C/C++ struct field value. For example, to use C++: `((struct foo *) buffer)->bar`
  in Python like: `foo.align(buf)[0]->bar`.
