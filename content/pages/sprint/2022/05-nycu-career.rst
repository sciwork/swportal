Open, Free, and Balanced Software Career: a Panel Discussion
============================================================

You are cordially invited to the sciwork joint event of career panel and project
sprint.  It will feature the discussions with experienced software developers in
the vibrant industries.  The Panelists_ will provide insightful information and
hands-on experience for how professional software development works globally and
locally.  Your questions are also welcomed.

The panel discussions will be especially helpful to those who are seeking a
professional career in the technology sectors.  Software is a central piece to
move forward the civilization and it is of utmost importance to invest in the
development.  As individuals, a key question is whether or not a career in
software is a suitable one, and if it is, how to pursue it?  We will discuss
these questions from different facets.

After the panel discussions we will have the usual sprints.  You can join both
the panel and the sprint or either of them.  Put your name and contact in the
hackmd document (`Sign Up`_).  Online discussions are available at
https://discord.gg/6MAkFrD .
