Scisprint is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the attendees,
and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and technology, which
demand more critical discussions than other applications of computer
programming.

In this sprint, we provide a `Sprint Training room <#Sprint Training room>`__ 
for the newcomers/less experienced developers to get prepared to contribute in the open-source projects.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all attendees to support more developers
to join in the open-source communities.
