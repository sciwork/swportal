To join the sprint, please bring your laptop and `sign up at kktix <https://sciwork.kktix.cc/events/scisprint-202303-hsinchu>`__.  You are also very welcome to bring your project, which
should be added in the `sprint note <#sprint-note>`__ too.  Please `contact us
<#contact-us>`__ if you have any questions.

Scisprint is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the attendees,
and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and technology, which
demand more critical discussions than other applications of computer
programming.

In this sprint, we provide a `Training Room <#Training-Room>`__ for the newcomers/less experienced developers to get prepared to contribute in the open-source projects.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all attendees to support more developers
to join in the open-source communities. 


Training Room
--------------------

The **command-line skills** are essential for a programmer. It is not only cool, but also the key to develop software productively. 
During this training room, `Mosky Liu <https://www.linkedin.com/in/moskyliu/?originalSubdomain=tw>`__ will teach some command-line skills and 
introduce some interesting topics about it. 

This training room will be like a workshop. There are some hands-on practices for you to get familiar with the course. Let's have fun with Mosky!

For more information, you could check it out in `project list <https://hackmd.io/@sciwork/scisprint-2303#Projects>`__.
If you have any questions, feel free to join `Discord <https://discord.gg/6MAkFrD>`__ and interact with us.
