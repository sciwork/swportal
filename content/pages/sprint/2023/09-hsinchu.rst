Scisprint, hosted by the sciwork community, is a monthly coding sprint. It would like to 
facilitate discussions and exchanges among people in the fields of science, numerical 
computation, and engineering. Participants, regardless of experience level, can gain valuable 
development insights in this event.

This event includes a `hacking session <#hacking-session>`__ and `career conversation <#career-conversation>`__.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all attendees to support more developers
to join in the open-source communities. 

Hacking Session
------------------

It aims to encourage collaboration and interaction among developers through project 
participation. The projects cover various fields, including but not limited to science, 
numerical computation, and engineering. You are also encouraged to share your own projects 
in scisprint. Refer to `project list <#project-list>`__ below for more details.
