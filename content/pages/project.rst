- **Project Contact:** Dboy(discord: @dboyliao#1295)

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework built on TensorFlow 
and optimized for Arm targets. It consists of a runtime library and an offline tool that handles 
most of the model translation work. This repo holds the core runtime and some example implementations 
of operators, memory managers/schedulers, and more, and the size of the core runtime is only ~2KB!

Cytnx
------

- **Project Link:** `Github <https://github.com/Cytnx-dev/Cytnx>`__
- **Project Contact:** Dboy(discord: @dboyliao#1295)

Cytnx is a scientific library which aims to provide similar experience as using numpy/scipy/pytorch.

Thus, although Cytnx is written in C++, there's python binding for users familiar wtih python. On the 
other hand, it aims to provides many efficient methods to manipulate tensors, tensor networks, linear 
algebra. All the critical calculation are come with CPU and GPU dedicated implementations to achieve 
fully usage of computer resource.
