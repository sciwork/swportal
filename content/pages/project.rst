modmesh seamlessly mixes C++ and Python through pybind11, allowing you to leverage the strengths of 
both programming languages for efficient PDE solving. We use Qt and Python to visualize the computation 
results to give you a better understanding of your PDE solution. modmesh also supports mesh visualization, 
currently in the Gmsh mesh file format. We have recently made efforts to improve the modmesh UI/UX.

The design allows it to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Everyone can use or contribute to modmesh.

We are a passionate and dedicated volunteer group committed to bridging the language gap in the Python community. 
Our primary mission is to make Python's official documentation accessible to the Traditional Chinese audience by 
providing accurate and comprehensive translations. Whether you are a seasoned Python developer or a language expert, 
we welcome individuals who are enthusiastic about Python and passionate about making knowledge accessible to all. 
Come join us in our monthly meetups where we share insights, discuss translation challenges, and build a collaborative 
community together!

sciwork portal
----------------

- **Project Link:** `GitHub <https://github.com/sciwork/swportal>`__
- **Project Contact:** Aya yu (discord: @tN#6722), Chester (discord: @chester), Wuxian (discord: @5x9527)

Sciwork Portal is a project for maintaining our official website - Sciwork.dev, which was built by Pelican 
with tailwindCSS, and deployed by Netfliy. We create the promotional pages for meetup and sprint events. Our 
team also maintains the sciwork conference page - conf.sciwork.dev.

We have always been actively trying to provide users a better web browsing experience, including information 
presentation and visual experience. Welcome to join us if you are interested in website maintence.

Common errors such as the misuse of synonyms and homophones are prevalent for both native and 
non-native Taiwan Mandarin users. This issue is indirectly attributed to the fact that large language 
models (LLMs) trained on data primarily sourced from the internet struggle to play a reliable role in 
Mandarin grammar checking tasks. Moreover, the token-by-token and linear training process of the LLMs 
cannot provide valid knowledge based on a thorough understanding of the non-linear structure of human 
language. However, from a linguistic perspective, training a model solely based on a mass amount of data 
is not the most direct solution. In reality, such errors are directly related to the non-linear structures 
of word classes and phrase structures. By analyzing and simplifying the structures of correct usages into 
code instructions, a linguistics-based model can effectively grasp the use of language in a manner similar 
to human native speakers. This enables the model to accomplish efficient Mandarin grammar checking tasks 
with minimal resources.

uTensor
--------

- **Project Contact:** Dboy(discord: @dboyliao#1295)

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework built on C++11. It simplifies model 
deployment by seamlessly converting TensorFlow-trained models into efficient C++ files that can be used to infer 
on the embedding device and integrate with optimized libraries such as CMSIS-NN by ARM with ease. Compared with 
the binary files, C++ source code will provide greater flexibility to modify the trained model for the embedding engineers. 

We provide the defaults for tensors, operators, and memory allocation. Just like the booming development of 
machine learning, we are also actively developing the above functions. Welcome to join us.

- **Project Contact:** Lin Chang Teng (discord: @jeffry1829#0568), Ke Hsu (discord: @kjjjjjjjjj1104#5128)

Cytnx (pronounced as sci-tens) is a tensor network library designed for classical/quantum physics simulations. 
It supports C++ and Python with almost identical interface and syntax, such that users can effortlessly switch 
between the two languages. Aiming at a quick learning process for new users of tensor network algorithms, the 
interfaces resemble the popular scientific libraries such as numpy, Scipy, and PyTorch. Symmetries present in 
physical systems can be easily defined and implemented in tensors. In addition, we provide a useful class called 
Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform the contractions in an optimal order that 
can be automatically computed. 

There are still many physics applications and GPU support backend being developed. Welcome to join us to contribute 
to Cytnx.

Commitizen-Tools
------------------

- **Project Link:** `GitHub <https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen>`__
- **Project Contact:** Wei Lee (discord: @clleew#6749)

Commitizen-tools allows teams to effectively implement version control that conforms to the specified rules. 
It uses interactive forms to create commit messages that meet conventional commits rules. It also bumps versions 
automatically using Semantic Versioning and generates a changelog using Keep a Changelog.

In addition, you can also customize your own rules to suit your team. Commitizen-tools is a widely used tool in 
many communities. We still have a lot of issues to fix and develop. Welcome to join us.
