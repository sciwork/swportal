    <h2 class="text-2xl text-center mt-10">About sciwork</h2>


The sciwork is a community for researchers and engineers to share and discuss
computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work.  We believe in
the power of openness, and use open source as a means to advance software
development for computational sciences.

As information technology blending in every aspect of human activities,
proficient use of programming languages is a prerequisite for conducting most
research and engineering work.  As the practitioners observed, the work evolved
into a hierarchy of skills that take years to acquire.  We need a thorough
understanding of the problem to solve as well as the mastery of computer
programming to deliver reliable solution.  It is overly challenging since
either of both is already complicated.  Sciwork would like to get involved in
the global effort to solve the issue of code development entangling with
science and engineering.

Our activities include but are not limited to `coding sprints <sprint>`__,
hands-on tutorials, and technical talks and `conferences <https://conf.sciwork.dev/>`__ (ex, sciwork 2023), on-line or off-line.
You are welcome to `join us <about.html>`__!
