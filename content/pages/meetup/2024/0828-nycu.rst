Subjects
------------------

modmesh development discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this Meetup, `Chun-Shih <https://github.com/ThreeMonth03?tab=followers>`__ 
will lead the discussion on the `modmesh project <https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh>`__. 
Through participating in the modmesh project discussion, you can develop the following skills:

* Learn how to communicate and contribute to open-source projects.
* Get familiar with package management and script writing in the development environment, 
  such as Qt6 and PySide.
* Learn to write modern C++, Python, and unit tests.

Additionally, this project is very beginner-friendly. 
For those who have participated fewer than 4 times, 
we have prepared a series of modmesh development tutorials, which include:

1. Setting up and demonstrating modmesh.
2. Basics of Git and GitHub.
3. Writing Pybind11 and Unittest.
4. Fundamentals of CMake, GNU Make, and GitHub Workflow.

Leetcode practice discussion
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this Meetup, `Kuan-Wei <https://github.com/visitorckw>`__ will lead the LeetCode study group. 
During the LeetCode discussions, we won't just focus on solving problems; 
there will be more in-depth technical discussions and communication practice, 
along with training on writing clean code. 
Through this activity, we aim to develop the following skills:

* A strong foundation in data structures and algorithms,
  enabling quick solutions to basic problems and follow-up questions.
* The ability to clearly express and present clean code,
  making algorithms easy to understand and maintain.

Prepare upcoming sciwork events
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Additionally, we will discuss the following items to prepare the upcoming events.

* Task arrangement for volunteers

About Meetup
------------

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the attendees,
and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and technology, which
demand more critical discussions than other applications of computer
programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source communities.

To join the meetup, please bring your laptop and `sign up <#sign-up>`__. Please
`contact us <#contact-us>`__ if you have any questions.
