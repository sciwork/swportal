Subjects

sciwork activity process automation discussion
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Meetup events are important within the sciwork community, serving as hubs for discussions and knowledges sharing. 
We are excited to announce a special meetup where we'll delve into the realm of process automation, leveraging 
the power of CI/CD and cutting-edge IT skills to enhance the sciwork event experience. The works are divided into : 

1. Decide the format of the meetup page.
2. Create the sesh event with api or other method.
3. Create the GitHub action to create the meetup page automatically.

We are currently using TextFSM to parse the format of meetup page.

About Meetup
------------

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the attendees,
and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and technology, which
demand more critical discussions than other applications of computer
programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source communities.

To join the meetup, please bring your laptop and `sign up <#sign-up>`__. Please
`contact us <#contact-us>`__ if you have any questions.
