Sciwork Meetup October 2022 in NYCU
============================================================

Date: 14th October, Friday, 2022

Computers have eaten the world but it did not come from vacuum. We rely so heavily on computer 
programming because the software developed solves so many problems. The versatile applications 
are the reason that everyone is encouraged to learn programming.

But there are differences between programming for work and for fun. Classrooms cannot provide 
everything needed to develop a professional career for coding. In the sciwork meetup, we will 
use a program combining a panel discussion and `hands-on coding sprints <#sprint-projects-and-requirements>`__ to provide practical 
points of view to writing code for work.

Sciwork hosted `a panel discussion in May <https://sciwork.dev/sprint/2022/05-nycu-career>`__. 
The panel discussion in this meetup will feature the same theme, but bring new perspectives from 
different Panelists_.

You can join both the panel and the sprint or either of them.
See `Sign Up`_, and more information is available in the hackmd note:
