Meetup 2023 June 28th in NYCU
========================================

* Date: June 28th, 2023
* Time: 18:30 -- 21:30 (3 hours)

To join the meetup, please bring your laptop. You are also very welcome to bring your project. Please `contact us
<#contact-us>`__ if you have any questions.

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the attendees,
and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and technology, which
demand more critical discussions than other applications of computer
programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all attendees to support more developers
to join in the open-source communities.
