About Meetup
------------

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the attendees,
and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and technology, which
demand more critical discussions than other applications of computer
programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all 
attendees to support more developers to join in the open-source communities. 

To join the meetup, please bring your laptop and `sign up <#sign-up>`__. You are also very welcome to 
bring your project. Please `contact us <#contact-us>`__ if you have any questions.
