Introduction
------------

Meetup is an event providing space for people to work on open source
projects together. We welcome any subjects that may interest the attendees,
and especially encourage code for science, engineering, and technology, which
demand more critical discussions than other applications of computer
programming.

We would like to provide a supportive and friendly environment for all attendees to support more developers
to join in the open-source communities. 

Sharing topic
------------------

**Subject (sharing): Running modmesh on NCHC HPC**

At this meetup, Terry will share the experience of running modmesh on NCHC HPC, along with the challenges he encountered.
