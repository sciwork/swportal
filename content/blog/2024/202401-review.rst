Weekly Meetup
-------------
In the January meetup, Yung-Yu introduced the CESE method, which is utilized in
the `modmesh project <https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh>`__ to solve the fluid dynamics problem. This provided modmesh
members with a deeper understanding of using numerical methods to solve the partial
differential equations. Meanwhile, Ming-Jie delved into researching the CESE method.
In addition, Kuan-Wei Chiu and Chun-Shih joined the modmesh team and actively contributed
to solve CI-related issues and offering valuable assistance to the project's progress.

Hsinchu Scisprint
-----------------
We also have a series of developments at January scisprint.
Li-Hsuan created new promotional pictures to improve the promotional effect on social media.
New member joined the uTensor team and successfully advanced the progress of Python binding.
pyLiteracy developed a new GUI interface that effectively highlights grammar errors in articles, and
meng joined the pyLiteracy team to learn how to check the grammar errors with the pyLiteracy project.
Furthermore, modmesh enhanced drawing capabilities for more effective mesh visualization. The swportal
team archived and organized the sciwork 2023 website during January scisprint to preserve essential
information from the event.


The February meetup frequency will be reduced due to school holidays. However, ongoing
development for each project will continue. We are prepared to welcome new students to
join our community.
